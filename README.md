# suml-project

This repo holds the project developed during SUML classes

The project aims to be the Recipe Advisor for students

It works very intuitively:
1. User provides ingredients ex. "Garlic, Cheddar, Pasta, Tomato, Paprika"
2. Application, powered by Machine Learning model, returns list of 5 most suitable recipes to be prepared with provided ingredients

All done via web application interface makes it easy to prepare food without overthinking "What should I cook?"
